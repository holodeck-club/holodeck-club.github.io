## Local development

First, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:holodeck-club/holodeck-club.github.io.git holodeck.club && cd holodeck.club
```

You'll need a local development server to work on this project.

Included in this repo is a Browsersync server that out of the box handles live-reloading and tunnelling (useful for loading sites on other networks and mobile devices).

To install the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

If you'd rather not depend on Node, there are [several other options of running the content locally](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally).
